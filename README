libpcb - A PCB layout library in C++
====================================

libpcb is a C++ library for laying out printed circuit boards. It is a
low-level library intended to be used for output and verification by
higher-level CAD utilities. It can also be used stand-alone for producing PCB
layouts from C++ source code. This allows the layout to be stored in source
control in a compact human-readable format.
